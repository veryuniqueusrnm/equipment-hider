## Equipment Hider
An all-in-one solution to hide every type of equipment that you can wear!

## What is this?
It's a resource pack that sets the model of various items hidden or invisible.

## What does it hide?

- Armors (Leather, Chain, Iron, Gold, Diamond and Netherite
- Elytra
- Turtle Helmet

## Why?

I used different texture packs for hiding the armor and the elytra on my skin, but these packs weren't updated in-time or stuck in a lower game version. So I wanted to solve it with one smart solution that hide everything.
